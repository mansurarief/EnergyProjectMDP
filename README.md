## Setting up the codespace

1. Activate your environment

```bash
julia --project=.
```

2. Install all the dependencies

3. Go to the code examples and run the REPL (a new terminal that will open when you run codes line by line)

To get out of "julia" or REPL, type

```bash
exit()
```

1. Git status

3. Commit the change with a proper message
```bash
git commit -m "Put your message"
```
